### Where is my data stored?

By default, your startup data (workspaces, tasks, finances) is stored locally on your device. Your user profile is synchronized with Firebase for cross-device access.

### How do I back up my data?

You can use the **Export** feature in the **Settings** menu to create a JSON backup of your workspaces and data. Keep this file in a safe place.

### I forgot my password. What should I do?

You can reset your password through the login screen by clicking on the "Forgot Password" link (if applicable) or by using the Google Sign-In method if you previously linked your account.
