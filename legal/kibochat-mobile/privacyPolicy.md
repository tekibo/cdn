# Privacy Policy

KiboChat is committed to protecting your privacy. Our philosophy is simple: your data should belong to you and stay with you.

## 1. Local Data Processing
KiboChat is a local-first application. This means:
- **Conversations**: Your chat history is stored in a local database on your device.
- **Documents**: Any files you upload for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) are processed and stored locally.
- **Embeddings**: Vector embeddings of your data are generated and stored on your device.
- **AI Inference**: The Large Language Models run entirely on your hardware.

## 2. No Data Collection
We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data, chat logs, or documents to any external servers. We do not have access to your conversations.

## 3. Third-Party Services
While the app itself does not collect data, you may interact with third-party services when:
- Downloading models from Hugging Face or other repositories. These services may have their own privacy policies.

## 4. Permissions
KiboChat may request the following permissions:
- **Storage**: To read documents for RAG and save downloaded models.
- **Internet**: Only used for downloading AI models from public repositories.

## 5. Security
Since your data is stored locally, its security depends on the security of your device. We recommend using device-level encryption and passwords.

## 6. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the app.

## 7. Contact Us
If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please contact us at support@tekibo.in.
