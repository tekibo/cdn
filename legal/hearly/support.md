## 2. Troubleshooting

### No Sound?
*   **Check Volume:** Ensure your phone's media volume is turned up.
*   **Check Headphones:** Make sure your headphones are properly connected. The app status should say "Headphones Connected".
*   **Check Permissions:** Go to your phone's Settings > Apps > Hearly > Permissions and ensure "Microphone" is allowed.

### Hearing Feedback (Squealing/Whistling Sound)
This is caused by the microphone picking up the sound from the headphones (feedback loop).
*   **Lower the Volume:** Reduce the amplification slider in the app.
*   **Check Fit:** Ensure your headphones fit tightly.
*   **Distance:** Keep your phone (microphone) away from your headphones.
*   **Use Noise Reduction:** Enable the Noise Reduction toggle in Audio Settings.
