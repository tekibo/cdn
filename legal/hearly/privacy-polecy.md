**Last Updated:** February 2026

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to **Hearly** ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you understand how your information is handled. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your data when you use our mobile application.

## 2. Information We Collect

### A. Personal Information
When you create an account, we collect the following information to manage your user profile and personalize your experience:
*   **Full Name**
*   **Email Address**

This data is stored securely using Google Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore.

### B. Audio Data (Microphone Usage)
**Hearly is a sound amplification tool.** To function, the app requires access to your device's **Microphone**.
*   **Real-Time Processing Only:** The audio captured by the microphone is processed in real-time on your device to amplify sound and apply your audio settings.
*   **No Recording or Storage:** We **do not** record, save, upload, or transmit your audio data to any server. All audio processing happens locally on your device (Edge Computing).
*   **No Eavesdropping:** The app is designed solely for hearing enhancement for the user wearing the headphones.

### C. Device and Usage Data
*   **Headphone Status:** We detect whether wired or Bluetooth headphones are connected to enable/disable the audio processing engine.
*   **App Settings:** We store your local preferences (volume levels, equalizer settings, theme preference) locally on your device using Shared Preferences.

## 3. How We Use Your Information
We use the collected information for the following purposes:
*   **Account Management:** To create and maintain your secure user account.
*   **App Functionality:** To provide real-time audio amplification and hearing aid features.
*   **Personalization:** To save your specific audio profiles (e.g., "Restaurant Mode", "Home Mode").
*   **Authentication:** To verify your identity when you log in (via Email/Password or Google Sign-In).

## 4. Permissions
The app requires the following permissions to function:
*   **Microphone (`RECORD_AUDIO`):** Strictly for real-time sound amplification.
*   **Bluetooth:** To detect and connect to Bluetooth headphones.
*   **Foreground Service:** To ensure the app continues to process audio even when running in the background or when the screen is off.

## 5. Third-Party Services
We use **Google Firebase** for backend services:
*   **Firebase Authentication:** For secure user login.
*   **Cloud Firestore:** For storing your user profile data (Name, Age, etc.).
*   **Google Sign-In:** To facilitate easy login.

Please refer to Google's Privacy Policy for more details on how they handle data.

## 6. Data Security
We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your personal information. Your profile data is stored in secured Firebase databases, and your audio data never leaves your device's RAM.

## 7. Children's Privacy
Our services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
