**Last Updated: January 28, 2026**

Caloscope ("we," "our," or "the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information.

## 1. Data Collection and Storage

### 1.1 Local Storage (Privacy First)

Caloscope is designed with a "privacy-first" approach. **All your caloric data, meal logs, weight history, and personal settings are stored locally on your device.** We do not host servers that store your personal health data.

### 1.2 No Account Registration

You do not need to create an account or provide an email address to use Caloscope. Your data is tied to your physical device.

### 1.3 Data Portability

You have full control over your data. You can export your data to a JSON file at any time using the Backup feature. You are responsible for the security of your exported files if you choose to store them in cloud services (like Google Drive) or external storage.

## 2. Third-Party Services

While we do not personally collect your data, Caloscope uses third-party services to provide certain features:

### 2.1 Google Mobile Ads (AdMob)

We use AdMob to display advertisements in the free version of the App. AdMob may collect and use certain data (such as your device's advertising ID) to show personalized or non-personalized ads.

- You can manage your ad preferences in your device's system settings.
- We do not share your meal logs or weight history with AdMob.

### 2.2 RevenueCat

We use RevenueCat to manage in-app purchases (such as the ad-free upgrade). RevenueCat may process transaction data provided by the App Store or Google Play Store to validate your purchase.

- This data is managed according to RevenueCat’s privacy policy.

## 3. Children's Privacy

Caloscope does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal info through third-party services, please contact us.

## 4. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App.

## 5. Contact Us
