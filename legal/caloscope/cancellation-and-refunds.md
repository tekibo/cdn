# Refunds and Cancellation Policy

Thank you for choosing Caloscope. Please read our policy regarding digital purchases and subscriptions carefully.

## 1. Digital Products Policy

Caloscope offers digital items, including "Pro" upgrades and subscriptions. Because these are digital products delivered instantly to your device upon purchase:

- **No Refunds:** All sales are final. We do not offer refunds or credits for any partial-month subscription periods or unused digital features.
- **Exceptions:** Refunds are only granted if required by local law or if the Google Play Store issues a refund at their discretion.

## 2. Subscription Cancellations

You have full control over your subscriptions:

- **Cancel Anytime:** You may cancel your subscription at any time through the Google Play Store "Subscriptions" menu.
- **Effect of Cancellation:** Upon cancellation, your "Pro" features will remain active until the end of your current paid billing period. You will not be charged again after the current cycle ends.
- **Deletion of App:** Please note that uninstalling the app **does not** automatically cancel your subscription. You must cancel it via the Play Store settings.

## 3. Contact Support

If you experience technical issues where a purchase was made but the features were not unlocked, please contact us immediately at [support@tekibo.in](mailto:support@tekibo.in) with your Transaction ID, and we will manually rectify the issue.
