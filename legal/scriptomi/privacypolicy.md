# Privacy Policy for Scriptomi

**Effective Date: January 24, 2026**

At Scriptomi, we believe that your medical and personal data belongs solely to you. This Privacy Policy outlines our commitment to your privacy and explains how our "Local-First" architecture ensures the security of your information.

---

## 1. Our Privacy Philosophy: Local-First
Scriptomi is designed as a **locally-stored application**. Unlike traditional cloud-based apps, Scriptomi does not transmit your medical records, prescriptions, or personal profiles to our servers. Your data remains on your device, under your complete control.

---

## 2. Information Management

### A. Medical & Personal Data
All information you enter into the app—including prescriptions, medical contacts, medication reminders, dose logs, and uploaded images—is stored in a secure, encrypted database **exclusively on your physical device**. 
*   **No Server Storage**: We do not maintain a database of your medical information on our side.
*   **No Data Transmission**: Your records are not uploaded to any external server managed by Scriptomi.

### B. Authentication Data
If you choose to sign in via Google or Email, we use **Google Firebase Authentication** to verify your identity. This process is handled directly between your device and Google's secure servers. Scriptomi does not store your passwords or sensitive login credentials on its own servers.

---

## 3. Data Storage and Security

### A. On-Device Security
Since your data is stored locally, its security depends on the security of your mobile device. We strongly recommend using device-level protections such as:
*   Biometric authentication (Fingerprint/Face ID).
*   Strong device passcodes.
*   Full-disk encryption (standard on most modern iOS and Android devices).

### B. Backup and Portability
Because we do not store your data, **we cannot recover your records if your device is lost, stolen, or damaged.** We recommend using your device's native backup systems (like iCloud or Google One) or Scriptomi's manual backup features to safeguard your information.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services
To provide essential app functionality, we integrate with a limited number of trusted service providers:
*   **Google Firebase**: Facilitates secure user authentication.
*   **RevenueCat**: Manages in-app subscriptions and premium feature access.
*   **Google Fonts**: Provides a clean and accessible user interface.

These providers do not have access to your locally-stored medical records.

---

## 5. Data Sharing and Zero-Tracking
*   **No Selling of Data**: We do not sell, rent, or monetize your information.
*   **No Third-Party Tracking**: We do not include third-party advertising trackers or analytics that profile your behavior for marketing purposes.
*   **No Data Sharing**: We do not share your information with insurance companies, pharmaceutical firms, or any other third party.

---

## 6. Your Rights and Controls
*   **Complete Deletion**: You can delete any record or your entire profile at any time. Once deleted from your device, the data is gone forever and cannot be retrieved by us.


---

## 7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy to reflect changes in the app's features. Any updates will be posted within the app with a revised "Effective Date."
